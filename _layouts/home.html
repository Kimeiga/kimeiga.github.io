      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <h3>I started programming games in early high school</h3>

      <p>I remember when my brother came back from Japan to visit and gave me his copy of Unity 3.x: Game Development Essentials. I barely knew what a computer was.</p>
      <p>But I really liked video games, and I loved to idea of making them. So I finished my studying early that night, and started the tutorial in the book. It was really thorough and within the week I had finished my first first person adventure game written in C#! Excited, I had my parents sat down and play it (no small feat).</p>
      <p>Ever since then, I've been programming games, websites, applications, languages, etc. I also love videography, sketching, and trying my best on the ukulele. Life has treated me well, and I've been lucky enough to get good grades while also having fun making cool things!</p>
      <p>I hope to continue that into the future; let's see where this goes.</p>
